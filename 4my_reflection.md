## 4. Open Source and Repo Setup  Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
Henry: The process wasn't all that hard. There is a 'Create repository button' and the form was pretty self-explanatory. Then, grabbing the SSH URL from GitHub, you head into terminal. Once you navigate to where you want to download the repository, you type git clone 'SSH URL'.
* Describe what open source means
Henry: Open-source means that you are putting in the source code of any product online. Others are able to access it and change it. This would be the opposity of copyrights/licenses/private property/etc.
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
Henry: Definitely as a newbie, I'm happy about Open Source. I will not be creating anything of value any time soon, so I have very little to worry about. The fact that I will have access to other people's code is an immense benefit for me, so I love it.
* Assess the importance of using licenses
Henry: Licenses are still definitely important. If you create a product of value, you want to be rewarded for that. Licenses protect you against theft and help ensure you get that reward.
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
Henry: I have had some issues with pushing through files. I have tried to push the entire phase-0-unit-1 file and that is probably not what I'm supposed to do. I went to OH and was advised to email phase0@devbootcamp.com, which I did.
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
Henry: Nothing else.
