      <p>Having always been a conservative and risk-averse person, I rarely partake in activities that I am uncomfortable with. I don't like being uncomfortable. I don't like being inadequate. That's why my new year's goal (yes, cheesy) was "being comfortable with being uncomfortable."</p>
      <p>Quitting my job and joining Dev Bootcamp is probably the biggest risk I am ever about to take. I can choose to continue my career in digital advertising, but I know I'll never be that happy in doing so. Programming has always been career that resonated well with my personality and thinking style.</p>
      <p>Even moreso, I want to make a positive impact on the world through creation of useful products, particularly in developing countries. I want to create web and mobile apps, which can reach those people and communities.</p>
