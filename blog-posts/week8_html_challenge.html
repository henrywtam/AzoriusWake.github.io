            <div class="title">Blog HTML/CSS Update</div>
            <div class="entry">
              <p>After spending about 15 hours updating my blog, I'm somewhat pleased with how it all looks. It's definitely a work in progress, but I have become a lot more comfortable with HTML and CSS through the process. Whereas before I was uncomfortable using HTML/CSS and was almost constantly frustrated with not getting the result I wanted/expected, I am finally starting to understand how it all works. It's not as random as I initially thought, and there's definitely a method to the madness.</p>
              <p>After my initial update, I asked a good friend of mine for his thoughts and advice. He gave me some great suggestions so I made changes afterwards. We bounced back and forth a few more times, and I'm set on this layout this week. I plan to spend more time on the blog this week as well to try out some other things. I got a lot of my inspiration from twitter, since it's a website I frequently visit and love their UI. I also visited my church's website (http://realitysf.com/) and love the UI there as well, and may try to work some features there into my website.</p>
              <p>This week has been quite eye-opening in terms of my confidence/happiness in my career switch. Not only did I start a side-project with a cohort using Ruby and enjoying that, I also really enjoyed figuring out HTML/CSS in updating my blog. Such a complete switch from hating HTML/CSS to somewhat liking it! It was something where I easily got lost in and before I knew it, I had sunk 3 hours revising my website. Thanks DBC for providing the opp to make the career switch into the field I belong in!</p>
