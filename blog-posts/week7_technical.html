            <title>SQL vs NoSQL</title>
            <entry>
              <ul>
                <li>SQL databases are primarily called Relational Databases (RDBMS), whereas NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed databases.</li>
                <li>SQL databases are table based databases whereas NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores. This means that SQL databases represent data in form of tables which consists of n number of rows of data whereas NoSQL databases do not have standard schema definitions which it needs to adhere to.</li>
                <li>SQL databases have predefined schema whereas NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.</li>
                <li>SQL databases are vertically scalable whereas the NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. SQL databases are scaled by increasing the horse-power of the hardware (increasing the CPU, RAM, SSD, etc, on a single server). NoSQL databases are scaled by increasing the database's servers in the pool of resources to reduce the load (add few more servers easily in your NoSQL database infrastructure).</li>
                <li>SQL databases uses SQL (structured query language) for defining and manipulating the data. In NoSQL database, queries are focused on collection of documents. Sometimes it is also called as UnQL (Unstructured Query Language). The syntax of using UnQL varies from database to database.</li>
                <li>SQL database examples: MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL. NoSQL database examples: MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb</li>
                <li>For complex queries, SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment whereas NoSQL databases are not good fit for complex queries. On a high-level, NoSQL donâ€™t have standard interfaces to perform complex queries, and the queries themselves in NoSQL are not as powerful as SQL query language.</li>
                <li>For the type of data to be stored, SQL databases are not best fit for hierarchical data storage. But, NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data. NoSQL database are highly preferred for large data set (i.e for big data). Hbase is an example for this purpose.</li>
                <li>For high transactional based applications, SQL databases are best fit for heavy duty transactional type applications, as it is more stable and promises the atomicity as well as integrity of the data. While you can use NoSQL for transactions purpose, it is still not comparable and sable enough in high load and for complex transactional applications.</li>
                <li>For support, excellent support are available for all SQL database from their vendors. There are also lot of independent consultations who can help you with SQL database for a very large scale deployments. For some NoSQL database you still have to rely on community support, and only limited outside experts are available for you to setup and deploy your large scale NoSQL deployments.</li>
                <li>For properties, SQL databases emphasizes on ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability) whereas the NoSQL database follows the Brewer's CAP theorem (Consistency, Availability and Partition tolerance).</li>
                <li>For DB types, on a high-level, we can classify SQL databases as either open-source or close-sourced from commercial vendors. NoSQL databases can be classified on the basis of way of storing data as graph databases, key-value store databases, document store databases, column store database and XML databases.</li>
