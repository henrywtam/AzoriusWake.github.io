    <div class="blogTitle">My 3 Favorite Websites</div>
    <div class="blogEntry">
      <a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a>
      <p>For the amount of content on the page, the website is very, very attractive. All of the actions that I would want to do (like tweeting, editing profile, checking notifications) are immediately there. If I want to scroll through my followee's content, there is a wide enough space devoted to that in which I can continue scrolling down forever. The design is very appealing and blue is my favorite color. :)</p>
      <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar/">Google Calendar</a>
      <p>Google has made a very useful and attractive calendar tool in Google Calendar. You have most of the tools you need to create appointments, edit your view, look at other calendars, etc. In design, it is minimilistic, but elegant. Compared to Outlook, Google's calendar is miles ahead in design.</p>
      <a href="http://www.9gag.com">9GAG</a>
      <p>While I'm not too impressed with the aesthetics of the site, especially the large amount of space given to ads, the user experience is awesome. The majority of 9GAG's content are humorous and quick to consume, and they have tailored their website to be incredibly quick, easy, and efficient. In the time it would take to consume 3 posts on Reddit, I would have already viewed 20 on 9GAG. It's the perfect site for someone with ADD to look for a few quick laughs.</p>
