            <div class="title">Stereotype Threat</div>
            <div class="entry">
              <p>Stereotype threat is a situational predicament in which people are or feel themselves to be at risk of confirming negative stereotypes about their social group. Since its introduction into the academic literature, stereotype threat has become one of the most widely studied topics in the field of social psychology. Stereotype threat has been shown to reduce the performance of individuals who belong to negatively stereotyped groups. If negative stereotypes are present regarding a specific group, group members are likely to become anxious about their performance, which may hinder their ability to perform at their maximum level. For example, stereotype threat can lower the intellectual performance of African-Americans taking the SAT reasoning test used for college entrance in the United States, due to the stereotype that African-Americans are less intelligent than other groups. Importantly, the individual does not need to subscribe to the stereotype for it to be activated. Moreover, the specific mechanism through which anxiety (induced by the activation of the stereotype) decreases performance is by depleting working memory (especially the phonological aspects of the working memory system).</p>
              <p>As for academic performance and belonging to the Asian ethnicity, I "should" be positively influenced. Thinking back, I'm just not too sure. I know I'm heavily influenced by expectations, but I don't know if everyone will be affected the same way and in the same impact level as I am. For example, if I expect to have pizza for dinner (going a different direction), my expectation buildup will make me heavily desire a burger for dinner. So even if a pizza, under most circumstances, will grant me equal-level happiness, I will be disappointed at a pizza dinner. Likewise, my expectations as an Asian American will affect my performance in every arena, as well as coming from a lower-middle income family, being a gamer, going to so-and-so school, etc. As an Asian, I am typically expected more of in the academic world, but expected less in the athletic world. With those expectations, do I perform above or below expectations? I think that is the bigger issue.</p>
              <p>Because I am expected to have higher standards in academics, I may study harder to ensure those standards are met. Or...I may not, because I don't want to be part of the stereotype. I think that decision/habit depends more on the individual. In sports, maybe I will try harder so I won't perpetuate the negative outlook of my background. Or, maybe it will give me reason to try less? There are a lot of possibilities and factors that play into it.</p>
              <p>In the end, stereotype threat or not, I don't think these used should be excuses for poorer performance for any group of people. Every person is unique. Every person is influenced (positively and negatively) by all different kinds of factors. It's what we do with our situation that should lead to the end result of our product.</p>
