            <div class="title">Asking the Right Questions</div>
            <div class="entry">
              <p>Here are some of my rules when asking questions</p>
              <div><b>0. Do some research on your own to find the answer.</b></div>
              <div>Roughly 80% of the time, I'm able to find a sufficient answer through another source (online search, article, book, contact, etc). Figuring it out on your own is good practice, even if it may be a bit inefficient. Also, when you do ask your question, the person who answers you will more likely help you out based on the mere fact that you alrieady tried figuring it out on your own. You may even save some of their time with what you've found so far.</div>
              <p></p>
              <div><b>1. Know the environment for where you're asking the question.</b></div>
              <div>You don't ask your classmates questions the same way you ask online. Your classmates probably have much more information for what you're looking for as they are encountering the same problems. Thus, you don't need to provide as much information as you would online. If you were to ask a question on stackoverflow.com, you'd want to include technical information (OS, language, programs, versions, etc.), additional details on the specific problem you are trying to solve, and maybe even sample code/data. So know who the audience you're asking questions.</div>
              <p></p>
              <div><b>2. Ask specific question/s.</b></div>
              <div>Make the question as clear and concise as possible. I'd also recommend including what your intetions are, as you can get completely different methods for solving the same problem. </div>
              <p></p>
              <div><b>3. Provide the necessary information.</b></div>
              <div>This goes along with rule 1. Depending on the environment, provide sufficient information so that your audience can actually help you. You want to minimize back-and-forth, so make sure you state all of the important information the other party does not know. As mentioned in rule 1, your PC environment is needed for those outside DBC, but you can probably assume DBC classmates/guides/teachers will know all that information.</div>
              <p></p>
              <div><b>4. When possible and beneficial, include data/examples/code/output.</b></div>
              <div>This will help put things together for your audience. They may be able to spot errors immediately just by looking at the code you wrote or the output you recieved.</div>
              <p></p>
              <div><b>5. Last thing. Be nice.</b></div>
              <div>Being nice goes a long way. Most of these people are taking time out of their (probably busy) schedules to help you with yours. So be nice. Respond kindly and don't forget the thanks! :)</div>
