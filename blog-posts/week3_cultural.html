            <div class="title">Gregoric Thinking Style and Fixed vs. Growth Mindset</div>
            <div class="entry">
              <p>According to this Gregoric Thinking Style test I have taken, I am mainly a Concrete Random and Abstract Sequential thinker.</p>
              <p>As a <b>Concrete Random</b> thinker, I like experimenting to find answers, take risks, use intuition, and solve problems independently. I learn best when able to use trial-and-error approaches, compete with others, and be given the opportunity to work through problems themselves. These are difficult for me: restrictions and limitations, formal reports, routines, re-doing anything once it's done, keeping detailed records, showing how I got an answer, choosing only one answer, and having no option.</p>
              <p>As an <b>Abstract Sequential</b> thinker, I like to be heard, analyze situations before making a decision, and applying logic in solving or finding solutions to problems. I learn best when I have access to experts or references, am placed in stimulating environments, and am able to work alone. These are difficult for me: being forced to work with those of differing views, too little time to deal with a subject thoroughly, repeating the same tasks over and over, have lots of specific rules and regulations, "sentimental" thinking, expressing my emotion, being diplomatic when convincing others, and not monopolozing a conversation.</p>
              <p>After having gone through almost 3 weeks at DBC, I have seen how my two thinking styles have affected my learning. While the concrete random has mostly been positive for learning HTML/CSS/JS, my abstract sequential has made a few things more difficult. Since the pace at DBC is so fast-paced, I am forced to move on from languages/topics/challenges faster than I would like, and not have the opportunity to completely learn them inside-out. Also, I often ask experts when I am uncertain, and in solo challenges, I am unable to ask friends (other engineers) for help. In order to combat this, I am forcing myself to get adjusted with DBC's pace and to trust in myself/cohorts/guides/system.</p>
              <p>I really enjoyed learning Carol Dweck's breakdown of a Fixed vs. Growth Mindset. While I would subscribe more to the growth mindset, I definitely see myself as a fixed mindset in certain areas and at certain times. I also attribute some of those limitations to my desire for comfort. In many instances, I will avoid challenges and give up easily because I'm unwilling to be uncomfortable. That's why "being comfortable with being uncomfortable" is one of my 2014 new year's resolutions, and DBC is definitely a part of that!</p>
