            <title>What are the differences between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning? #DBCRAFP</title>
            <entry>
              <p>First off, all elements start out as static, meaning they don't have any default values but flow naturally onto a page.</p>
              <p>With relative positioning, you add in positioning attributes and that would only affect the element/s relative to where it would be if it was static. So if you type in left: 10px, the element would position itself 10px to the left "relative" to where it would have been without that attribute (static).</p>
              <p>With absolute positioning, you are able to place an element exactly anywhere on the page. You give it top, right, bottom, left position attributes, and the element will take that position of the page. These values will be relative to the next parent element with relative or absolute positioning.</p>
              <p>Lastly, with fixed positioning, the element is positioned relative to the viewport, or the browser window itself. The viewport doesn't change when the window moves, so even if a user scrolls the page, the element will stay in position.</p>

            <title>Kitchen vs. Table</title>
            <entry>
              <p>Having always been a conservative and risk-averse person, I rarely partake in activities that I am uncomfortable with. I don't like being uncomfortable. I don't like being inadequate. That's why my new year's goal (yes, cheesy) was "being comfortable with being uncomfortable."</p>
              <p>Quitting my job and joining Dev Bootcamp is probably the biggest risk I am ever about to take. I can choose to continue my career in digital advertising, but I know I'll never be that happy in doing so. Programming has always been career that resonated well with my personality and thinking style.</p>
              <p>Even moreso, I want to make a positive impact on the world through creation of useful products, particularly in developing countries. I want to create web and mobile apps, which can reach those people and communities.</p>

            <title>My 3 Favorite Sites</title>
            <entry>
              <a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a>
              <p>For the amount of content on the page, the website is very, very attractive. All of the actions that I would want to do (like tweeting, editing profile, checking notifications) are immediately there. If I want to scroll through my followee's content, there is a wide enough space devoted to that in which I can continue scrolling down forever. The design is very appealing and blue is my favorite color. :)</p>
              <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar/">Google Calendar</a>
              <p>Google has made a very useful and attractive calendar tool in Google Calendar. You have most of the tools you need to create appointments, edit your view, look at other calendars, etc. In design, it is minimilistic, but elegant. Compared to Outlook, Google's calendar is miles ahead in design.</p>
              <a href="http://www.9gag.com">9GAG</a>
              <p>While I'm not too impressed with the aesthetics of the site, especially the large amount of space given to ads, the user experience is awesome. The majority of 9GAG's content are humorous and quick to consume, and they have tailored their website to be incredibly quick, easy, and efficient. In the time it would take to consume 3 posts on Reddit, I would have already viewed 20 on 9GAG. It's the perfect site for someone with ADD to look for a few quick laughs.</p>
