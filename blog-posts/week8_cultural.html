            <div class="title">Dealing with Conflict</div>
            <div class="entry">
              <p><b>Discuss a time you had an emotional conflict with someone. What was it about? What happened?</b></p>
              <p>This is a really minor one, but it happened today so I'll go with it. Earlier in the week, I asked to grab dinner with one of my closest friends. After deciding on tonight, she cancelled in the afternoon because she was too tired from a morning hike and was busy at work. She apologized on text, but I stopped replying after that. That's it - super small spat.</p>
              <p><b>What was the source of the conflict?</b></p>
              <p>In a previous post, I mentioned integrity is one of the most important values to me. A major part of that is being honest and keeping your word. While I understand that things come up and you have to cancel plans at times, I'm less understanding when you're just tired or lazy. Everyone makes sacrifices, and you make them for what's important to you. In my mind, her cancellation makes me think that I'm just not that important to her.</p>
              <p><b>How did you handle that conflict?</b></p>
              <p>I kind of just stop talking to her for a little while. It's my childish/immature way of showing my annoyance with her. In general, I have realized that's how I deal with most conflicts-both large and small. I tend to withdraw, re-evaluate, and make a decision going forward with the conflict in mind. If it's a small conflict with a good friend, my withdrawal won't last too long and I'll get over it. If it's a med/large conflict with a not-so-great friend, that could mean a complete withdrawal. The end decision varies, but my initial withdrawal action usually occurs. Below is Harold Grossman's "Compass of Shame", which explain the four defensive directions a person handles shame.</p>

              <p><b>Did your actions make the conflict better or worse?</b></p>
              <p>I'm not too sure. If I communicated my annoyance, perhaps my friend would make a greater effort to keep her promises in the future. However, it's also possible that she could have also been upset that I wasn't sympathetic enough of her situation (early morning event, work being busy, maybe other stuff). Who knows what would really happen.</p>
              <p><b>If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?</b></p>
              <p>I feel that many times, the withdrawal has saved me from making a bad, emotionally-driven decision. At other times, with my withdrawal, I let go of issues that need to be brought up. It all depends. After 28 years of living life, I have come to accept and appreciate my withdrawal tendency. Now, during my evaluation/re-evaluation phase, I try to make the wisest decision given all that I know. Sometimes, it means overlooking an issue. Other times, it means having the courage to raise it up. Again, it all depends.</p>
              <p><b>What did you learn from this experience?</b></p>
              <p>I don't know if I learned anything from this specific instance, but it does reinforce my affirmation of my withdrawal/evaluation process.</p>
