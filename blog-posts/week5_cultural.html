            <title>Pair Programming + Feedback</title>
            <entry>
              <p>Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer, pointer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.</p>
              <p>While reviewing, the observer also considers the "strategic" direction of the work, coming up with ideas for improvements and likely future problems to address. This frees the driver to focus all of his or her attention on the "tactical" aspects of completing the current task, using the observer as a safety net and guide.</p>
              <p>My limited experience with pair programming at DBC has been incredibly beneficial and englightening. While I initially thought having a partner would slow down my work, I found it to be quite the opposite. Not only have I been completing those challenges more quickly, the final work is much more complete. I've learned so much from my peers, and highly encourage pair programming!</p>
              <p>I'm also a huge fan of giving/receiving feedback. As a fairly critical person, I tend to notice the flaws in people. And as someone who doesn't like confrontation, I often won't bring it up to them, even if I know it will help them a lot. Having constant (anonymous) feedback allows me to give my thoughts to others that I think can improve their abilities.</p>
              <p>Also, I am constantly trying to improve myself so I always welcome feedback. No one is perfect, especially me, so I want to hear as much as I can from others to make me a better everything. I'll probably get a little hurt, but I  get over it quickly, and really try to learn/apply the feedback/criticisms, rebukes, etc. from others. Life is all about learning and growing!</p>
