            <title>Issues in Tech</title>
            <entry>
              <p>If you keep up with tech-related news, you'll soon start becoming unfazed by massive amounts of cash. WhatApp was purchased for $19B, Beats by Dre for $3B, Twitch for $1B. Snapchat is valued at $10B and companies are constantly getting $10M+ funding in the Series A, B, C, and more rounds. You lose touch with the value of money and thus goods.</p>
              <p>While it's great that these brilliant people are providing so many people with a better experience, I would prefer to have those same minds solve larger issues, like poverty, energy efficiency, education, medicine, etc. How badly does the world need another messaging app, streaming service, headphones, or ad network? Not so much in my opinion. That's why I was very pleased to read this TechCrunch article:</p>
              <a href = "http://techcrunch.com/2014/08/19/new-at-y-combinator-startups-solving-huge-problems/"> --> New at Y Combinator: Startups Solving Huge Problems <-- </a>
              <p>Y Combinator is one of the most prestigious startup incubators so it's incredible to see a shift in the type of companies in it.There are companies building nuclear reactors, creating vaccines for HIV and AIDs, and quantum computing. These companies can really push the bounds for both helping advance science, technology, and society!</p>

            <title>Enumerables</title>
            <entry>
              <p>The Enumerable mixin provides collection classes with several traversal and seraching methods, and with the ability to sort. The class must provide a method 'each', which yields successive members of the collection. If Enumberable#max,#min, or #sort is used, the objects in the collection must also implement a meaningful <=> operator, as these methods rely on an ordering between members of the collection.</p>
              <p>Since arrays are very popular in Ruby programming, I'll discuss them a bit. Here are some array enumberator methods: collect/!, combination, cycle, delete_if, drop_while, each, each_index, find_index, index, keep_if, map/!, permutation, reject/!, repeated_combination, repeated_permutation, reverse_each, rindex, and select/!.</p>
              <p>The map enumerator is particularly useful and one of my favorites.</p>
              <p>map { |obj| block } -> array</p>
              <p>Examples</p>
              <div>(1..4).map { |i| i*i }      #=> [1, 4, 9, 16]</div>
              <div>(1..4).collect { "cat"  }   #=> ["cat", "cat", "cat", "cat"]</div>

            <title>Gregoric Thinking Style and Fixed vs. Growth Mindset</title>
            <entry>
              <p>According to this Gregoric Thinking Style test I have taken, I am mainly a Concrete Random and Abstract Sequential thinker.</p>
              <p>As a Concrete Random thinker, I like experimenting to find answers, take risks, use intuition, and solve problems independently. I learn best when able to use trial-and-error approaches, compete with others, and be given the opportunity to work through problems themselves. These are difficult for me: restrictions and limitations, formal reports, routines, re-doing anything once it's done, keeping detailed records, showing how I got an answer, choosing only one answer, and having no option.</p>
              <p>As an Abstract Sequential thinker, I like to be heard, analyze situations before making a decision, and applying logic in solving or finding solutions to problems. I learn best when I have access to experts or references, am placed in stimulating environments, and am able to work alone. These are difficult for me: being forced to work with those of differing views, too little time to deal with a subject thoroughly, repeating the same tasks over and over, have lots of specific rules and regulations, "sentimental" thinking, expressing my emotion, being diplomatic when convincing others, and not monopolozing a conversation.</p>
              <p>After having gone through almost 3 weeks at DBC, I have seen how my two thinking styles have affected my learning. While the concrete random has mostly been positive for learning HTML/CSS/JS, my abstract sequential has made a few things more difficult. Since the pace at DBC is so fast-paced, I am forced to move on from languages/topics/challenges faster than I would like, and not have the opportunity to completely learn them inside-out. Also, I often ask experts when I am uncertain, and in solo challenges, I am unable to ask friends (other engineers) for help. In order to combat this, I am forcing myself to get adjusted with DBC's pace and to trust in myself/cohorts/guides/system.</p>
              <p>I really enjoyed learning Carol Dweck's breakdown of a Fixed vs. Growth Mindset. While I would subscribe more to the growth mindset, I definitely see myself as a fixed mindset in certain areas and at certain times. I also attribute some of those limitations to my desire for comfort. In many instances, I will avoid challenges and give up easily because I'm unwilling to be uncomfortable. That's why "being comfortable with being uncomfortable" is one of my 2014 new year's resolutions, and DBC is definitely a part of that!</p>

            <title>Why is JavaScript popular in web development? What are the great things about JavaScript? What are its limitations?</title>
            <entry>
              <p>JavaScript is the most popular client-side language for all browsers, so it is everywhere in web development.</p>
              <p>There are plenty of reasons that make JavaScript so popular. First, it is easy to learn, especially coming from a programming background. Second, there is a large open source community with built-out libraries for everything you can think of. Lastly, it is lightweight and fast, and works great with Java and C++.</p>
              <p>While JavaScript is a great language, it still does have its limitations. There are concerns regarding security issues. Also, there can be rendering variations across different platforms and browsers, which makes testing difficult.</p>

            <title>What are the differences between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning? #DBCRAFP</title>
            <entry>
              <p>First off, all elements start out as static, meaning they don't have any default values but flow naturally onto a page.</p>
              <p>With relative positioning, you add in positioning attributes and that would only affect the element/s relative to where it would be if it was static. So if you type in left: 10px, the element would position itself 10px to the left "relative" to where it would have been without that attribute (static).</p>
              <p>With absolute positioning, you are able to place an element exactly anywhere on the page. You give it top, right, bottom, left position attributes, and the element will take that position of the page. These values will be relative to the next parent element with relative or absolute positioning.</p>
              <p>Lastly, with fixed positioning, the element is positioned relative to the viewport, or the browser window itself. The viewport doesn't change when the window moves, so even if a user scrolls the page, the element will stay in position.</p>

            <title>Kitchen vs. Table</title>
            <entry>
              <p>Having always been a conservative and risk-averse person, I rarely partake in activities that I am uncomfortable with. I don't like being uncomfortable. I don't like being inadequate. That's why my new year's goal (yes, cheesy) was "being comfortable with being uncomfortable."</p>
              <p>Quitting my job and joining Dev Bootcamp is probably the biggest risk I am ever about to take. I can choose to continue my career in digital advertising, but I know I'll never be that happy in doing so. Programming has always been career that resonated well with my personality and thinking style.</p>
              <p>Even moreso, I want to make a positive impact on the world through creation of useful products, particularly in developing countries. I want to create web and mobile apps, which can reach those people and communities.</p>

            <title>My 3 Favorite Sites</title>
            <entry>
              <a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a>
              <p>For the amount of content on the page, the website is very, very attractive. All of the actions that I would want to do (like tweeting, editing profile, checking notifications) are immediately there. If I want to scroll through my followee's content, there is a wide enough space devoted to that in which I can continue scrolling down forever. The design is very appealing and blue is my favorite color. :)</p>
              <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar/">Google Calendar</a>
              <p>Google has made a very useful and attractive calendar tool in Google Calendar. You have most of the tools you need to create appointments, edit your view, look at other calendars, etc. In design, it is minimilistic, but elegant. Compared to Outlook, Google's calendar is miles ahead in design.</p>
              <a href="http://www.9gag.com">9GAG</a>
              <p>While I'm not too impressed with the aesthetics of the site, especially the large amount of space given to ads, the user experience is awesome. The majority of 9GAG's content are humorous and quick to consume, and they have tailored their website to be incredibly quick, easy, and efficient. In the time it would take to consume 3 posts on Reddit, I would have already viewed 20 on 9GAG. It's the perfect site for someone with ADD to look for a few quick laughs.</p>
