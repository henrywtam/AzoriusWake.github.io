      <p>Pair programming is a collaboration environment where two people can work together on a single project. We're able to apply multiple perspectives and hopefully achieve a higher quality product.</p>
      <p>There are two roles in pair programming, driver and navigator. The driver listens to the navigator and tries to implement what he is saying. The navigator guides the driver to his vision for the goal/project.</p>
      <p>Pair programming is a very common practice among the workplace. DBC helps us familiarize ourselves not only with code, but prepare us for the real workworld.</p>
      <p>Lebron James pairs relaly well with his (former) teammmate Dwayne Wade, and so we have his picture on the right.</p>
      <p>Henry's Reflection: I enjoyed the pairing. While Murat and I (cohort) were quite efficient, having Ben (leader) throw in advice, comments, and answer questions was extremeley helpful. Since we were getting work done quickly, I stayed with being a driver and Murat navigator. I did wish we tried switching roles to see how that would go.
